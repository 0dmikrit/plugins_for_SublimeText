# Plugins
- Name: CreateTestFilePython
- Folder: python_autotest
- Description: This plugin creates a `test_<NameFolder>` folder inside the directory and creates a `test_<NameFile>` file in it. This is very convenient when there are long names, and so a folder for tests is created in the directory and each file is labeled.
